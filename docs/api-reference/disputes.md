## Retrieving the dynamic flow for disputes 

**`POST /v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/dispute-form/flows/step/{{scheme}}/{{reason}}?transactionId={{transactionId}}`**

Retrieves the JSON for initiating the dispute flow. This endpoint should be used in conjuction with Wise's [Dynamic Flow framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@transferwise/dynamic-flows).

The JSON data in the response must be passed into the Dynamic Flow Framework which handles the rest of the multi-step dispute submission including the generation of the subsequent pages (if needed) and the creation of the dispute, along with all the required documents.

A sample implementation of the dynamic flow for Disputes can be found [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/transaction-dispute-jp4k89?file=/src/App.js).

Path and Request Parameters**scheme** text

The network of the card that was used to make this transaction. One of `MASTERCARD` or `VISA`

**reason** text

Dispute reason code supplied by the [dispute reasons API](/api-reference/disputes#get-dispute-reasons)

**transactionId** text

The ID of the transaction that is being disputed. It can be a comma separated list of IDs if the reason code has the `supportsMultipleTransactions` flag

Request Body**email** text

Email used to receive communications regarding the dispute from Wise (ex. your support team's email)

### Setting up the API

You will need to implement a GET API with the following format:
 **`GET https://{{yourApiUrl}}/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/dispute-form/flows/step/{{scheme}}/{{reason}}?transactionId={{transactionId}}`**

This API should forward the call to **`POST https://{{wiseUrl}}/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/dispute-form/flows/step/{{scheme}}/{{reason}}transactionId={{transactionId}}`** along with the request parameters. This is required as the dynamic flow returned by Wise will automatically be configured to call your GET API In order to redirect the Dynamic Flow JavaScript library to your domain please use baseUrl or fetcher as part of the dynamic flow setup

See [example backend implementation](/api-reference/disputes#example)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/dispute-form/flows/step/{{scheme}}/{{reason}}?transactionId={{transactionId}}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": support@partner.com 
  }'
```

### Response

## Customizing your Dynamic Flow 

Wise's Dynamic Flow uses Bootstrap for responsive UI, based on a 12-grid column layout. The defaults for currency selection, amount and file upload are `col-xs-12`, `col-sm-6`, and `col-xs-12` for the rest. The CSS classes used are listed below. These class selectors can be used to override existing CSS

To override the existing CSS, add a new stylesheet and place the reference to that file after a Bootstrap CSS reference (if any), so that it will override any previous style properties. Alternatively, add !important to a property/value to override ALL previous styling rules for that property. Avoid using this for all properties, as the stylesheet will be large and more difficult to debug. In this code example, modify the CSS file imports in App.js to view the different overriding style sheets.

Please note that some of the form elements also use core Bootstrap classes, so be careful when you modify the styles.

An interactive demo can be found [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/transaction-dispute-css-example-1poqmi?file=/overriding.md).
