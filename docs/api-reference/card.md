## Retrieve sensitive card details 

Wise is a PCI DSS compliant provider, and stores all of your cards' data securely. The scope for PCI compliance depends on your use case and will impact how you integrate with Wise.

Sensitive card details endpoints allow you to retrieve card data such as Primary Account Number, CVV or PIN. You can use it to set a pin if required in the card order flow. For all sensitive card details endpoints, please follow the [detailed guide](/guides/product/issue-cards/sensitive-card-details).

### Fetch RSA encryption key

This endpoint is used to fetch our RSA public key. This key is required in the [sensitive card details flow](/guides/product/issue-cards/sensitive-card-details).

#### Response

**version** number

Version of the key

**key** text

The RSA public key

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://twcard.wise-sandbox.com/twcard-data/v1/clientSideEncryption/fetchEncryptingKey
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>'
```

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "key": "<encryption key>"
}
```

### Get Card Sensitive Details

This endpoint is used to fetch the card Primary Account Number, security code (CVV2), expiry date and cardholder name. It requires an `api token`and a `card token` set in the headers.

To retrieve sensitive card details, the card must be in either `ACTIVE` or `FROZEN` status. A 403 response will be returned when getting sensitive card details for a card in any other status.

This endpoint is SCA protected when it applies. If your profile is registered within the UK and/or EEA, SCA most likely applies to you. For more information please read more [implementing SCA](/guides/developer/auth-and-security/sca-and-2fa).

### Request

**keyVersion** number

The version of the key to use. It is always set to 1.

**encryptedPayload** text

Your [JWE payload](/guides/product/issue-cards/sensitive-card-details).

### Response

**nonce** text

An arbitrary UUID issued from the cryptographic communication

**cvv2** text

Your card CVV2

**pan** text

Your card Primary Account Number

**expiryDate** text

Your card expiry date

**cardholderName** text

Name on the card

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://twcard.wise-sandbox.com/twcard-data/v1/sensitive-card-data/details 
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' 
  -H 'x-tw-twcard-card-token: <your card token>'
  -d '{
    "keyVersion": 1,
    "encryptedPayload": <your JWE> 
  }'
```

```json
{ 
  "nonce": "33d51227-9ad6-4624-b4b7-7853b56076dd",
  "cvv2": "111",
  "pan": "4396910000012345",
  "expiryDate": "10/31",
  "cardholderName": "John Smith"
}
```

### Get Card PIN

This endpoint is used to fetch the card PIN. It requires an `api token`and a `card token` set in the headers.

This endpoint is SCA protected when it applies. If your profile is registered within the UK and/or EEA, SCA most likely applies to you. For more information please read more [implementing SCA](/guides/developer/auth-and-security/sca-and-2fa).

### Request

**keyVersion** number

The version of the key to use. It is always set to 1.

**encryptedPayload** text

Your [JWE payload](/guides/product/issue-cards/sensitive-card-details).

### Response

**nonce** text

An arbitrary UUID issued from the cryptographic communication

**pin** text

curl -X POST \
  https://twcard.wise-sandbox.com/twcard-data/v1/sensitive-card-data/pin 
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' 
  -H 'x-tw-twcard-card-token: <your card token>'

{ 
  "nonce": "33d51227-9ad6-4624-b4b7-7853b56076dd",
  "pin": "1234",
}
```

## Reset pin count 

**`POST /v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/reset-pin-count`**

If the wrong PIN have been entered more that 3 times, future transactions on the card will be blocked with `PIN_ENTRY_TRIES_EXCEEDED` error message.

To unblock your transactions, use this endpoint to reset the PIN count to 0.

Additionally, there are instances where you will also need to reset the PIN count directly at the ATM.

#### Response

200 - No Content

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/reset-pin-count \
