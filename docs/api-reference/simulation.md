## Simulate transfer state change 

Simulation doesn't work with email transfers.You need to fund transfer before calling simulation endpoints. Calling of processing is required even after the funding call transfer state has changed to processing automatically.While transfer state simulation calls will respond with 200 in real time, the process internally is asynchronous. Please ensure you give at least 5 seconds in between simulation calls

**`GET /v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/processing`**

Changes transfer status from incoming_payment_waiting to processing.

**`GET /v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/funds_converted`**

Changes transfer status from processing to funds_converted. Please refer to our 

[regional guides](/guides#regional-guides) for any special regional requirements when simulating payments.

**`GET /v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/outgoing_payment_sent`**

Changes transfer status from funds_converted to outgoing_payment_sent.

**`GET /v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/bounced_back`**

Changes transfer status from outgoing_payment_sent to bounced_back.

**`GET /v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/funds_refunded`**

Changes transfer status from bounced_back to funds_refunded. Please note that this simulation [will not trigger a refund webhook](/guides/developer/sandbox-and-production#not-testing-in-sandbox).

#### Response

Transfer entity with changed status.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v1/simulation/transfers/{{transferId}}/processing \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>'
```

## Simulate verification state change 

Use these endpoints to simulate a profile's verification state changing to PASSED.

This is useful for testing the profiles#verification-state-change webhook and is a prerequisite for setting up a Multi-Currency Account (MCA).

### Verify a specific profile

**`POST /v1/simulation/profiles/{{profileId}}/verifications`**

Accepts both user and application API tokens.

Path parameter `profileId` is required to identify the profile you wish to verify.

No content is returned with a 200 response code.

### Verify all profiles for a user

**`POST /v1/simulation/verify-profile`**

This endpoint verifies all profiles associated with the authenticated user.

Accepts user API tokens only. The profiles are identified via the token.

No content is returned with a 200 response code.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v1/simulation/profiles/{{profileId}}/verifications \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>'
```

```
No Content
```

## Simulate a balance top-up

## Simulate a card transaction authorisation 

**`POST /v2/simulation/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/transactions/authorisation`**

## Simulate a card transaction reversal 

**`POST /v1/simulation/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/transactions/reversal`**

Simulates a transaction reversal request in the sandbox environment. The `amount.value` field can be set to 0 for a full reversal, or a positive value that represents the intended final value of the transaction after a partial reversal.

For example, if a transaction value was originally 10 SGD, and the intended final value is 3 SGD, `amount.value` should be set to 3. This means there is a partial refund of 7 SGD.

### Request

**amount.value** decimal

Transaction amount

**amount.currency** text

Currency code

**transactionType** text

The type of the transaction. Use the same transaction type from the previous Authorisation request

**ref** Object

The transaction reference. This can be obtained from a previous Authorisation request

Response

Returns a simluated card reversal, while the funds are not yet cleared.

**reference** Object

The transaction reference

**error** text

An error returned by the transaction, if it exists
