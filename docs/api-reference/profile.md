## Remove trusted verification from a profile 

**`DELETE /v3/profiles/{{profileId}}/trusted-verification`**

This endpoint allows partners to remove the verification that was given to the profile through them creating the profile. This does not delete a profile nor archive it, it simply removes the trusted verification from that partner.

Note that this uses a `client-credentials-token` and not a user `access_token` for authentication.

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v3/profiles/{{profileId}}/trusted-verification \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <client-credentials-token>' 
```

```
No Content
```

## Open an update window for a profile 

**`POST /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/update-window`**

Opens the update window for updating the profile information: details, addresses, directors, owners, others.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/update-window \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' 
```

## Close an update window for a profile 

**`DELETE /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/update-window`**

Deletes the update window for updating the profile.

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/update-window \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' 
```

## Retrieve profile extension requirements for a profile 

**`GET /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extension-requirements`**

This endpoint is deprecated. Please check the [Additional Verification](/api-reference/verification) endpoints for providing additional verification details for a profile.

After having a profile created, in some situations we can need more specific information about it. In order to know which fields are required for a given profile, and to send the information over, we expose a few endpoints:

`GET /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extension-requirements`
 `POST /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extension-requirements`

and

`POST /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extensions`
 `GET /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extensions`

The `GET` and `POST` profile extension-requirements endpoints help you to figure out which fields are required to create a valid profile for different regions. You can use this data to build a dynamic user interface on top of these endpoints.

The `POST` and `GET` profile extensions endpoints allow you to send the extra profile information and retrieve it, respectively.

**This format for dynamic forms is the same as the one used for recipient creation.** See [Recipient.Requirements](/api-reference/recipient#account-requirements)

This is a step-by-step guide on how these endpoints work.

### Using profile extension requirements

1. 

First create a profile. See [User Profiles Create (Personal)](/api-reference/profile#create-personal) and [User Profiles Create (Business)](/api-reference/profile#create-business)

2. 

Call `GET /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extension-requirements` to get the list of fields you need to fill with values in the "details" section for adding information that will make a profile valid.

3. 

Some fields require multiple levels of fields in the details request. This should be handled by the client based on the `refreshRequirementsOnChange` field. A top level field can have this field set to true, indicating that there are additional fields required depending on the selected value. To manage this you should create a request with all of the initially requested data and call the POST `extension-requirements` endpoint. You will be returned a response similar the previously returned data from GET `extension-requirements` but with additional fields.

4. 

Once you have built your full profile extension details object you can add it to add information to the profile.

### Building an user interface

When requesting the form data from the `extension-requirements` endpoint, the response defines different types of extensions that can be added. Each extension type then has multiple fields describing the form elements required to be shown to collect information from the user. Each field will have a type value, these tell you the field type that your front end needs to render to be able to collect the data. A number of field types are permitted, these are:

| type | UI element |
| --- | --- |
| text | A free text box |
| select | A selection box/dialog |
| radio | A radio button choice between options |
| date | A text box with a date picker |

Example data is also included in each field which should be shown to the user, along with a regex or min and max length constraints that should be applied as field level validations. You can optionally implement the dynamic validation using the `validationAsync` field, however these checks will also be done when a completed profile extension is submitted to `POST /v1/profiles/{{profileId}}/extensions`.

### Response

## Check profile verification status 

You can check the verification status of a profile using the following API. This is a profile-specific API resource which should be accessed using an access token acquired for the profile.

### Response

**source_currency** text

ISO 4217 currency code.

**current_status** verification status code (see below)

Current verification status

**maximum_entitled_amount** decimal

Maximum entitled amount that can be transferred with the user's given verification state.

#### Guide on how to process the API response

| current_status | maximum_entitled_amount | How to process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| verified | any value | Profile is verified. maximum_entitled_amount field can be ignored (note that some regional limits may still apply). |
| not_verified | 0 | Profile is not verified. Any payments from the user will be delayed by verification. |
| not_verified | > 0 | Profile is not verified yet but the user is allowed to make payments up to a certain limit. Once the limit is reached, following payments might be delayed because of additional verification requirements. Please note that the limit is cumulative and not per transfer. This state might allow some users to experience the product immediately even if the verification process isn't complete yet. |

| Verification status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| verified | The profile is sufficiently verified to start making payments (note that some regional limits may still apply) |
| not_verified | The profile is currently awaiting verification or there are pending issues with the verification process |

Please note that we do not expose any finer details of customer verification.
