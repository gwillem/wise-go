# Card Order
With this set of APIs, you will be able to create cards for your customers. You can also retrieve and view the status of your current card orders, as well as the list of available card programs for the user.

On production, each personal profile can order at most 1 physical card and 3 virtual cards. On sandbox, we allow up to 10 physical cards and 30 virtual cards for testing purpose. However, no more than 3 virtual cards can be ordered per day. This limit includes cards and card orders.

ID of the card order

**profileId** number

Profile ID

**clientId** text

Client ID

**cardProgram** CardProgram

[Card program](/api-reference/card-order#card-program-resource) of the card holder.

**address** Address

[Address](/api-reference/card-order#card-address-resource) set during card order

**cardToken** text

Token of the card associated with card order. Nullable.

**replacesCard** text

A string for replacement card. Not supported at the moment.

**creationTime** text

Time when the card order is created

**modificationTime** text

Time when the card order was last modified

Status of the card order before card is issued. 
 Checkout [card order status](/api-reference/card-order#card-order-status) for more information.

**cardHolderName** text

Name of the card holder.

**phoneNumber** text

Phone number associated with the card order.

**lifetimeLimit** number

Maximum amount of spending on the card once issued. Nullable.

**deliveryEstimate** text (ISO-8601)

The estimated time when the card will be delivered. There are few scenarios to be mindful of:

1. For virtual card the delivery estimate will be close to the creationTime. As it does not require delivery.
2. For physical card in `PLACED` status, the delivery estimate is calculated assuming that the order requirements will be fulfilled today (refreshed daily).
3. For physical card after `PLACED` status, we provide a best effort estimation, and it should not be used as delivery timing as we will have separate delivery tracking (subject to region availability) for physical card that is coming soon.
**deliveryDetails (optional)** DeliveryDetails

[Delivery details](#delivery-details-resource) of a physical card order. For virtual card, this value is null

### Card program resource 

A Card Program is what Wise refers to all the cards that you will be issuing with us, grouped by product type and by issuing country.

**name** text

The name of the card program

**scheme** text

The network of the card program. One of `MASTERCARD` or `VISA`

**defaultCurrency** text

The default currency assigned to the card program

**cardType** text

The type of the card. It can be one of `VIRTUAL_NON_UPGRADEABLE` or `PHYSICAL`

```json
{
  "cardPrograms": [
    {
      "name": "VISA_DEBIT_BUSINESS_UK_1_CARDS_API",
      "scheme": "VISA",
      "defaultCurrency": "GBP",
      "cardType" : "VIRTUAL_NON_UPGRADEABLE"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Delivery option resource 

The delivery method will be defined during scoping phase. Please reach out to your Implementation Manager for more information

- 

`POSTAL_SERVICE_STANDARD` is typically utilized by default. This type of delivery can't be traceable, hence deliveryVendor, trackingUrl, and trackingNumber value will return null.

- 

`POSTAL_SERVICE_WITH_TRACKING` is available in certain regions. In Brazil, this is the default delivery method. Tracking details can only be known for physical card when the status is `PRODUCED` or `COMPLETED`.

- 

We also offer a `KIOSK_COLLECTION` delivery method. Please refer to this [guide](/guides/product/issue-cards/card-kiosk-collection) for more information.

The deliveryOption field should only be specified for `KIOSK_COLLECTION` during card order creation.

Resource**deliveryVendor (optional)** text

The name of the delivery vendor

**trackingUrl (optional)** text

The url to track the card delivery

**trackingNumber (optional)** text

The tracking number of the card delivery

**deliveryOption** text

The delivery option used on the card order

```json
{
  "deliveryDetails": {
    "deliveryVendor": "DHL",
    "trackingUrl": "https://www.dhl.com/gb-en/home/tracking/tracking-express.html?submit=1&tracking-id=1999473803",
    "trackingNumber": "1999473803",
    "deliveryOption": "POSTAL_SERVICE_WITH_TRACKING"
  }
}
```

### Card order status 

The card order response will contain the `status` field. The initial status is `PLACED` or `REQUIREMENT_FULFILLED` depending on the requirement fulfillment state.

The possible 'status' values are:

- `PLACED`- The card order is created. The card will be generated once it has fulfilled all the requirements
- `REQUIREMENTS_FULFILLED` - The card order has fulfilled all the requirements and the card should be generated in a short while
- `CARD_DETAILS_CREATED` - The card has been generated
- `PRODUCED` - The physical card has been produced and waiting to be picked up by delivery vendor (physical card only)
- `COMPLETED` - The card has been activated and is ready to use. The card order is completed
- `CANCELLED` - The card order has been cancelled. This can happen if you reach out to Wise Support to cancel a card order
- `RETURNED` - Delivery failed, the physical card has been returned and will be blocked (physical card only)

## Card address resource 

To create a card order, make sure to follow country specific address fields and validation. If your country is not listed in the dropdown below, select `Other`.

For virtual cards, the address field will be used as a billing address. It will be used for AVS checks in countries where is it required.

For physical cards, the address field will be used as a delivery address. It will be used to deliver your card as well as AVS checks in countries where is it required.

**Please select a country:**

## Create a card order 

**`POST /v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/card-orders`**

The `program` field value is retrieved from [retrieve all card programs](/api-reference/card-order#retrieve-card-programs) endpoint.

This request requires an extra field in the header, `X-idempotence-uuid`. This should be generated and used for any subsequent retries in the event that the initial request fails.

When you issue a card under a business profile, the cardholder will automatically default to the [business representative](/api-reference/profile#create-business).

If the cardholder is not the business representative, create a cardholder [personal profile](/api-reference/profile#create-personal) and add the profileId of the cardholder profile to the `cardHolderProfileId` field on the card order request.

### Request

**program** text

The name of the card program

**cardHolderName** text

The cardholder's name

**embossedName** text

For partners onboarded after 1/3/2025, we will use the profile phone number for any Card-related One-Time Password (OTP) requests. See [3ds](/guides/product/issue-cards/3ds). Ensure that the phone number is valid and starts with a "+" followed by the country code. For example, a valid phone number would be +6588888888.

**address** Address

The cardholder's billing address or delivery address. See [address](/api-reference/card-order#card-address-resource)

**deliveryOption (optional)** text

The option to deliver your card. See [delivery option](/api-reference/card-order#delivery-details-resource)

**lifetimeLimit (optional)** integer

Optionally sets a lifetime spending limit on the card. A lifetime limit of 0 means that a card cannot be used until the lifetime limit is updated.

Update the status of a card order based on its `cardOrderId`. The status can be updated to one of the following:

1. `CANCELLED`
2. `COMPLETED` (deprecated)

A card order can be updated to `COMPLETED` for all statuses except `CANCELLED` and `COMPLETED`.

The behaviour for card order cancellation differs across card order statuses and is listed below:

- `PLACED`: Card order can be cancelled with no further action required.
- `REQUIREMENTS_FULFILLED`, `CARD_DETAILS_CREATED`, `PRODUCED`: Card order can be cancelled, and its associated card will be blocked. However, the physical card may have already been produced and may be in delivery. If so, the card will still reach the end user's address. This should be communicated to the end user to prevent confusion.
- `COMPLETED`, `RETURNED`: Card orders in these statuses cannot be cancelled.
Updating a card order status to `COMPLETED` is deprecated. Check with our team whether this is supported in your integration.Request**status** text

The intended new status of the card order. One of `CANCELLED` or `COMPLETED` (deprecated)
