# Card Transactions
These APIs allow you to retrieve information on transactions that are made on your user's cards.

Operations 

[GET/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/transactions/{{transactionId}}](/api-reference/card-transaction#get)

Get card transaction by ID

## Transaction states 

The possible `state` values are:

- `IN_PROGRESS` - The transaction has been authorized but not captured.
- `COMPLETED` - The transaction has been captured and/or settled.
- `DECLINED` - The transaction has been declined.
- `CANCELLED` - The transaction has been cancelled.
- `UNKNOWN` - Default fallback status if the state can't be confirmed.

The transition from `CANCELLED` to `COMPLETED` is an edge case. Wise is releasing the customer funds after 7 days (30 days for pre-authorization) if the merchant has not capture the transaction, the state becomes `CANCELLED`. But the merchant can decide to capture the transaction on a later date, the state will then be `COMPLETED`.

## Decline Reasons 

The decline reason field provides information about the specific issue that led to the transaction being declined, helping the merchant and the customer troubleshoot the problem.

While the 'decline reason' field provides valuable information about the specific issue that led to the transaction being declined, it may not cover all possible reasons for a decline, such as technical issues or unforeseen circumstances.

Please be aware that new decline reasons may be added in the future, and not all decline reasons are currently documented. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and regularly review the documentation to ensure accuracy.

Please exercise caution when communicating reasons to your customers, as some may not be relevant or may cause confusion. If you have any questions or concerns, we are here to assist you.**ACCOUNT_INACTIVE**

Balance related to the transaction is not active.

Please ensure that all outstanding actions have been completed before using your card, as this may help avoid any potential issues or declines.

**ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED**

This transaction has been declined pending further compliance checks.

It may have been flagged for potential sanctions issues.

**ATM_PIN_CHANGE_NOT_ALLOWED**

PIN change via ATM terminal is not allowed.

**BLOCKED_COUNTRY**

Transactions were made in unsupported countries.

Check out this [link](https://wise.com/help/articles/2935771/where-can-i-use-my-wise-card) to see if the country is included in our list of supported nations.

It is possible for a merchant to be based in a supported country and have an address registered in a blocked country, albeit infrequently.

**BLOCKED_SUBSCRIPTION**

Our system cannot facilitate this transaction as the customer has opted out of recurring payments with this merchant.

**CARD_EXPIRED**

The card provided has reached its expiration date, making it invalid for this transaction.

**CARD_FROZEN**

The customer or our customer service team has put this card on a temporary hold.

If the card has not been frozen by the customer, it may be worth investigating further.

To resume spending, advise customer to unfreeze the card.

**CARD_INACTIVE**

The card is either not active or has not been received by the customer, so we are unable to proceed with the transaction.

**CARD_BLOCKED**

The card has been blocked and can't be used anymore.

**CARD_PARTNER_SUSPENDED**

Our internal team has deactivated the account for compliance reasons related to AML, fraud, or EDD.

Please contact our team if you believe this is an error.

**CHIP_PIN_ENTRY_TRIES_EXCEEDED**

The PIN is restricted on the chip of the card due to excessive incorrect entries.

The blocked PIN can be unlocked at an ATM using specific steps that vary depending on the machine and country, such as PIN management or PIN operations followed by unblocking the PIN.

**CONNECTION_ISSUE**

There's a connection problem occurring during the transaction.

**CONTACTLESS_PIN_ENTRY_REQUIRED**

Contactless payment systems sometimes require a PIN for authentication purposes to protect users' accounts from potential fraud or tampering.

In Europe, contactless payment transactions that follow one after the other require PIN verification as an additional security measure.

**CREDIT_TRANSACTIONS_NOT_SUPPORTED**

Credit is not supported for this specific transaction. Please review our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://wise.com/gb/legal/acceptable-use-policy-eea) for further information.

**CUMULATIVE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED**

In certain jurisdictions, there are restrictions on the amount that can be spent. For further details, please refer to the following resource about [spending limits](https://wise.com/help/articles/2899986/what-are-my-spending-limits).

**DECLINED_ADVICE**

There's a problem with the message from the processor, so we might not be able to accept it because it could be incomplete or unsafe.

Just because we can't process the payment right now doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the card.

Tell the customer that there was a technical issue with the payment and to try again later.

**INCORRECT_CVV**

The customer accidentally entered the wrong security code.

Please advise the customer to check their card details and try again.

If the customer's saved card details are correct, they should remove their card details from the merchant's website and then add them back again.

The customer made a mistake and entered the wrong expiration date for their card.

If the customer's saved card details are correct, they should remove their card details from the merchant's website and then add them back again.

**INCORRECT_PIN**

The customer entered their PIN incorrectly.

Please advise the customer to check their PIN and try again.

If the PIN is correct and still fails, kindly suggest resetting the PIN.

**INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS**

The customer doesn't have enough money in their account to make the payment.

Please advise the customer to add money to their account and try again. In most cases, this will resolve the issue.

**INVALID_3DS_UCAF**

The 3D Secure checks failed during the transaction, so the customer should try again and ask for authentication.

**INCORRECT_ARQC**

ARQC (Authorization Request Cryptogram) is a cryptogram generated by the card during a transaction, which we validate on our end. If it's incorrect, it could indicate a faulty card, a fraudulent attack, or an issue with the POS terminal.

**INCORRECT_ICVV**

ICVV (Integrated Circuit Card Verification Value) is a security feature used to validate the authenticity of a card during chip-based transactions. There were problems reading the chip on the card, which may indicate an issue with the card's chip, the terminal, or the transaction process. It is best to wait a bit and try again.

**INVALID_MERCHANT**

Transaction from a specific merchant is declined by scheme. The merchant should clarify the exact cause with scheme.

**INVALID_TRANSACTION**

We don't support certain types of transactions, so the customer should ask the merchant to use a different payment method or try a different merchant.

The BRL won't be automatically exchanged to other currencies.

If the customer wants to continue with the payment, they need to change the currency they're using.

**MANDATE_LOCAL_CASH_WITHDRAWAL_NOT_ALLOWED**

Currently, we do not provide ATM withdrawal services in the country where your transaction is taking place using your card.

The customer has attempted to make a contactless payment at a Point of Sale (POS) or ATM, but their card has not been activated for chip and PIN transactions.

**PROCESSING_ERROR**

Our system is currently experiencing technical difficulties.

Please advise the customer to try again after a brief period of time.

**RESTRICTED_MODE**

Although rare, restricted mode can happen, and it's advisable to advise the customer to replace their card promptly as our system should have already informed them.

In this mode, more secure payment methods like chip and PIN, contactless, mobile wallets, and online payments with 3DS are allowed, while less secure methods like magnetic stripe and online payments without 3DS are not permitted.

**REVERSAL_NOT_MATCHING_AUTH_CURRENCY**

The merchant has issued a reversal instruction for a different currency than what was originally requested during the authorization process.

**SCA_SOFT_DECLINE**

This transaction has been flagged by the scheme and cannot be processed.
