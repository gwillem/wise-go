# One Time Token
These endpoints are deprecated. Please refer to [strong-customer-authentication](/api-reference/strong-customer-authentication) section to integrate with SCA.

Represents a list of challenges that a user needs to clear in order to access protected resources.

Commonly used for [Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA](/guides/developer/auth-and-security/sca-and-2fa).

Learn from our [guide](/guides/developer/auth-and-security/one-time-token) to understand One Time Token Framework.

To ease reading in this document, we will use OTT as an abbreviation for one time token.

The Verify PIN/FaceMap/Device Fingerprint APIs are currently in closed Beta and subject to change. Please speak with your implementation manager if you would like to use these APIs

## The One Time Token resource 

We suggest the following method to check if the OTT is ready to access an SCA protected endpoint.

Iterate through `challenges` array and look for any 

[challenge](/api-reference/one-time-token#challenge-object) that has the following properties:

1. `required` is true
2. `passed` is false
**oneTimeToken** text

Unique identifier of a one time token.

**challenges** ChallengeObject[]

Array of [ChallengeObject](/api-reference/one-time-token#challenge-object).

**validity** number
