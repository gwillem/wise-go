# Batch Group
A batch group is a named collection of up to 1000 transfers that can be managed as a single unit. Batch groups are primarily used for funding multiple transfers with a single payment.

## The Batch Group resource 

Many Batch Group API endpoints return a *batch group resource*. Batch group resources have the following properties:

**id** text

Batch group ID

**version** integer

Batch version, used for concurrency control. This number is updated whenever there is a change to the batch group state (its status, the identity of the transfers in the batch, etc). 

 Some API operations will require this version in requests, and operations may be rejected when the requested version does not match the server’s version. 

 The version will be a signed integer and is not ordered with respect to any previous version.

**name** text

Descriptive name

**sourceCurrency** text

Source currency code (ISO 4217 Alphabetic Code) - This currency is expected to be used for the funding the batch group

**status** text

Current *Batch Group Status* (see below)

**transferIds** array

The IDs of all transfers successfully added to the group

**payInDetails** array

List of pay in details (see *Pay In Details* below). Provided only when the batch-group is in the `COMPLETED` state

**status** text

- `NEW`: New batch group with zero or more transfers. Able to have more transfers added to it. Any transfers in a `NEW` group cannot be yet be funded and paid out.
- `COMPLETED`: The batch group has had all the desired transfers added to it and is now closed to further changes. The transfers in the group are now able to be funded and paid out.

Note: `COMPLETED` does not imply that payouts have been successfully completed. It means that all required transfers have been created and associated with the batch group.
- `MARKED_FOR_CANCELLATION`: Cancellation of the transfers in the batch group was requested.
- `PROCESSING_CANCEL`: Transfers in the group are being cancelled. This takes time in Wise's system.
- `CANCELLED`: Transfers in the group have been cancelled.
