# Card Kiosk Collection
These APIs are designed to allow you to print and encrypt your card directly from a kiosk machine. The card information will be sent to our card manufacturer to configure and print the card on-site on a kiosk machine.

The card printing process will automatically begin once the request is received by our card manufacturer.

During the printing process, you will be notified via webhook about any [card production status change](/guides/developer/webhooks/event-types#cards-card-production-status-change).

Before using these APIs, make sure to read the guide on [kiosk collection](/guides/product/issue-cards/card-kiosk-collection#card-kiosk-collection).

Please reach out to your Implementation Manager for more information on these APIs.

Operations 

[PUT/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#produce-card)

Produce a card

[GET/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#retrieve-card-production-status)

Retrieve a card production status

## Production status flow 

These statuses represent the lifecycle of a card production.

- `READY` - The card is ready for production. The 

[produce card endpoint](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#produce-card) can be called.
- `IN_PROGRESS` - The card is in production at the kiosk machine.
- `PRODUCED` - The card is produced and collected. This is a final state.
- `PRODUCTION_ERROR` - The card production failed. The [produce card endpoint](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#produce-card) can be called again to retry the card production.

A card with production status `PRODUCED` will trigger an asynchronous call to update the associated card order to `PRODUCED` status.

## Produce card 

**`PUT /v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production`**

This endpoint sends the card production request to a kiosk machine. To confirm that card information has been successfully created, please listen to [card-production-status-change](/guides/developer/webhooks/event-types#cards-card-production-status-change) webhook with status `READY`.

Cards that were created over 60 days ago will result in a 422 error code and cannot be retried, this is due to the data being obfuscated on our side. In this case a new card order has to be created.Request**kioskId** text

Identifier that specifies on which kiosk the card should be produced.

#### Response 

- `200 - OK` - The card information have been successfully sent to the kiosk machine.
- `422 - Unprocessable Content` - The card information can't be processed by the kiosk machine. For more details, check the error code returned.
**status** text

The value will be `IN_PROGRESS` if the card information has been successfully sent to the kiosk machine, otherwise it will be `REQUEST_ERROR`.

**kioskId** text

Identifier that specifies which kiosk machine is producing the card.

**occurredAt** text (ISO-8601)

Time when the card production request has been successfully sent to the kiosk machine.

**errorCode (optional)** text

Code returned when sending the card production request is not successful. The possible values are listed in [request errors](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#request-errors).

**description (optional)** text

Detailed description of the error code.

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "kioskId": "WIS00001"
  }'
```

```json
{
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "kioskId": "WIS00001",
    "occurredAt" : "2024-01-01T12:24:56.121Z"
}
```

```json

    "occurredAt" : "2024-01-01T12:24:56.121Z",
    "errorCode": "PIN_VERIFICATION_FAILED",
    "description": "The PIN cannot be verified because the server is unreachable",
}
```

## Retrieve card production status 

**`GET /v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production`**

You should rely on the [card production status change](/guides/developer/webhooks/event-types#cards-card-production-status-change) webhook to be notified on the production status.

In some situations, you might want to use this endpoint to synchronously retrieve the production status of a card.

### Response

**status** text

Current production status. The possible values can be found in the [production status flow diagram](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#production-status-flow).

**kioskId** text

Identifier that specifies which kiosk machine is producing the card. When the status is `READY`, this value is null.

**occurredAt** text (ISO-8601)

Time when the card production request has been sent to the kiosk machine.

**errorCode** text

Code returned when card production is not successful. The possible values are listed in [production errors](/api-reference/card-kiosk-collection#production-errors). Nullable.

**description** text

Detailed description of the error code. Nullable.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.wise-sandbox.com/v3/spend/profiles/{{profileId}}/cards/{{cardToken}}/production' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your api token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json
